# Car License Plate Detection
Capstone Project on Machine Learning using Artificial Neural Networks. 
The dataset for the project includes multiple images of cars, along with their license plates and their respective XML files containing annotations.
Convolutional Neural Networks(Conv2D) layers along with MaxPooling2D and OpenCV library are used to detect license plates from the images.
